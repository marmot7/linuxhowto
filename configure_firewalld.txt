 
# Introduction
Firewalld provides dynamic firewall services, supporting both networking and "zones." Here we will focus on configuring a basic firewall could be useful for a public facing server.

## Enabling the Firewall
Since Centos 7 includes Firewalld by default, you can use _systemctl_ to _start_ *Firewalld* and to _enable_ it at boot:  

• `systemctl start firewalld`  
• `systemctl enable firewalld`  

Confirm that Firewalld is `running` with this command:  
`firewall-cmd --state`  

## Reviewing the defaults
Confirm that the default zone is `public`.
`firewall-cmd --get-default-zone`  

*Confirm that the only active zone is `public`:*  
`firewall-cmd --get-active-zones`

*For future reference, you can view a list of all the available zones:*  
`firewall-cmd --get-zones`

*This should return a list similar to this:*   
```  
work drop internal external trusted home dmz public block
```  

To list what services you currently have authorized for the public zone:
`firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-services`

List the services again after adding any additional services to confirm they were what you intended.

## Managing services
Firewalld uses *runtime* and *permanent (persistent)* configuration sets. *Add services rather than ports to make it easier to understand and manage your Firewalld configuration.*

To view a list of the available services:
`firewall-cmd --get-services`  

If you want to find out more about service configirations: 
`cd /usr/lib/firewalld/services`

There you will find an xml file for each service. For example, the file for `httpd` will look something like this:  

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<service>
  <short>Secure WWW (HTTPS)</short>
  <description>HTTPS is a modified HTTP used to serve Web pages when security is important.</description>
  <port protocol="tcp" port="443"/>
</service>  
```

### Adding or removing services  
You can add services for *runtime* or *permanently* (i.e., to load on boot).

*To add or remove a service in runtime:*  
• `firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=https`  
• `firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-service=https`  

*To add or remove a service permanently:*  
• `firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=https --permanent`   
• `firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-service=https --permanent`  

### Allowing or denying ports
While it is best practice to add services rather than ports, you can allow or disable traffic via individual ports for runtime and to run permanently (i.e., load at boot).

*To allow or deny traffic to port 443 in rutime:*  
• `firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=443/tcp`  
• `firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=443/tcp`  

*To allow or deny traffic to port 443 permanently:*  
• `firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=443/tcp --permanent`    
• `firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=443/tcp --permanent`  

*To add a rule to take effect immediately **and** permanently:*  
• `firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=https --permanent`  
• `firewall-cmd --reload`  

*List the services after any changes to make sure they're what you intended:*  
`firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-services`

*Reload firewalld then list services to confirm that services you intended to add permanently took effect:*  
• `firewall-cmd --reload`
• `firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-services`

Allowing only those services and ports that you need would be a good basic configuration for a public facing server. You can do a lot more with firewalld, including setting up custom services and configuring multiple zones.
